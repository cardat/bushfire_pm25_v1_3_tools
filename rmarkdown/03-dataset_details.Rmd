# Overview

This dataset consists of daily PM2.5 predictions across Australia using the revised random forest model of the BushfireSmoke project V1.3. It corrects the input predictors of and supersedes V1.2.

Data is provided in NetCDF format in the `Bushfire_Smoke_PM_Exposures/Bushfire_specific_PM25_Aus_2001_2020_v1_3/data_derived` directory of the CARDAT data repository. Each NetCDF contains the predicted PM~2.5~, components of an STL decomposition of PM~2.5~ and flags that may be used to indicate probable firesmoke days. One NetCDF holds daily data of a single year, which in total cover the time period from 2001-01-01 to 2020-06-30. Spatial resolution and extent is 5km by 5km across Australia (excluding offshore territories) (EPSG:3577).
