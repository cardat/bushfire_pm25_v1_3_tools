# Case study - CART model {#flags-cart}

A Classification and Regression Tree model was fitted, providing all flags as predictors and validated against the [Biomass Smoke Events Validated Database](https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/biomass_smoke_events_db), a database of known bushfire smoke events. This database was collated manually through a combination of satellite images (hand-drawn smoke plumes) and written accounts (e.g. government reports, newspapers).

The final tree predicts a bushfire smoke day where:

- smoke_pm25_v1_3 = 1
- whs_15degreeC = 0
- active_fires_50000 = 1
- trimmed_smoke_2SD_v1_3 = 1

That is to say:

- the total PM~2.5~ is above the 99th percentile (for that raster cell), AND
- the mean daily temperature is NOT below 15Â°C, AND
- there is a satellite-detected active fire present within 50km, AND
- the trimmed remainder is higher than 2SD of the remainder (for that raster cell)
