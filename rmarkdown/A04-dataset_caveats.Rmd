# Caveats

## Missing data

Due to the unavailability of solar exposure data, there are several missing days of prediction prior to 2010. Solar exposure data and predicted PM~2.5~ is complete from 2010 onwards.

Dust flags derived from the CAMS are not available pre-2003.

Due to unavailability of landscape fire data before November 2020 (the basis of `active_fire` predictors), PM~2.5~ could not be estimated for years pre-2001.

## Negative predicted PM~2.5~ values

The predicted PM~2.5~ is occasionally negative. This could be a consequence of the training data, which allowed negative values in the response variables. It may also be a result of the application of the model to environments dissimilar to the locations in the training data. Most observational monitors are located in populated areas and close to human infrastructure, and therefore the model may be less accurate in rural or unpopulated regions.

The `prediction_out_range` variable indicates where the predicted PM~2.5~ fall outside the range of the response variable values provided to train the model. There are a variety of methods to handle negative values:

- consider using `prediction_out_range` and/or a conditional on the PM~2.5~ value to identify improbable values.
- if improbable/implausible, consider removing these values (and conducting an interpolation to fill if needed) or truncating to some chosen threshold

## Infilled data

Raster cells covering coastal areas were not well-covered by PM~2.5~ predictions as a consequence of the predictor extraction process. For predictors in raster format, values were extracted to the prediction grid through point extraction - for each grid cell, the value of the predictor raster at the centre of that cell. This returned NA if the centre of the cell lay over a water body and was not covered by the predictor raster. 

As much of Australia's population is concentrated along coastal regions, the dataset was extrapolated to ensure all missing coastal pixels were filled. Extrapolation was performed for missing coastal pixels by: 

- calculating a focal window (size 3, queen-type contiguity) maximum on the binary flags (i.e. if any adjacent cell is flagged, the target cell is also flagged); and
- calculating a focal window (size 3) mean on the PM~2.5~ prediction and decomposition components (i.e. mean of all non-NA adjacent cells)


Additionally, flags were originally extracted for the superseded V1.2 grid and were remapped to the V1.3 grid (rather than performing a full extraction for the V1.3 grid). As the V1.2 grid did not entirely cover the V1.3 grid, flags were extrapolated by taking a 15km buffer on unmapped grid points and setting the flag to 1 if any V1.2 grid cell within the buffer was flagged 1.

## Artefacts

Predicted PM~2.5~ was produced on a grid of 5km resolution but may not vary smoothly across the entirety of the extent due to the limited resolution of input predictors.
Although grid was predicted at 5km resolution, there is a noticeable grid pattern of roughly 55km resolution. This pattern matches that of MERRA-2 satellite raster grid resolution.

Also visible are circular regions (particular in northern Australia) corresponding to the 100km radius buffers of the em_fire_dens_fireskm2_100000_daily predictor.

There are also seemingly random small ‘patches’ in fixed positions across the daily predictions. The size and position of these patches correspond to populated regions and are related to the predictor pop_dens_10000.
